## User´s Guide  

To create the necessary folders you must use:  `make dirs`

To create the object code of the *threadFormat* class you must use:  `make threadFormat`  
To create the object code of the *utils* class you must use:  `make utils`  
To create the object code of the *SSOOIIGLE* class you must use:  `make ssooiigle`  

To link the object code and generate the executable you must use: `make exe`  

All of the above can be generated by: `make all`  

Once the executable has been generated, I have made two tests that you can test as: `make test_a` or `make test_b`.  

The *test_a* will search the book Leyes de Liderazgo for the word escuela with 3 threads.  
The *test_b* will search the book VIVE TU SUEÑO for the word carecen with 4 threads.  


If you wish to *execute at your choice*, once you have generated the executable you must take into account the following format: `./SSOOIIGLE <path_file> <word> <n_thread>`
